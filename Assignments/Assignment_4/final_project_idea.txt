The Great Idea
1. My final project is going to be dealing with data concerning bryophyte, or any organism that we can find good data on, microbiome diversity. 
2. Ideally, I would have my own data from my research project to be analyzing, but we don’t live in an ideal world, so I will have to find an available data set. I know that bryophyte microbiome studies are scarce, and I’m not sure how lucky I’ll be in finding one. I have skimmed and haven’t found anything thus far. I could always use the microbiome data of any other organism and conduct similar analyses. I suspect the data is going to be a lot of base pair chains associated with environmental variables, and our job will be to find out what is present using taxonomic units and other species recognizing software. I’ll most likely be finding my data from google scholar papers. I know there are better places to look I just don’t know where they are. We will hash out the data soon, I’m just not sure what I’m supposed to be looking for exactly or what our analyses are going to be looking like. I know that’s very vague but that’s what I understand to this point.
